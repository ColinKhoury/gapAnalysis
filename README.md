gapAnalysis
===========

The `gapAnalysis` package is created to enable users interested in conservation issues, to assess the conservation status of elements of nature (`gapAnalysis` was initially created to assess the conservation of crop wild relatives (CWR) in genebanks), using environmental niche models (EDM) and other geographic information systems (GIS) tools.

The methodology implemented is based on [Ram√≠rez-Villegas et al., 2010](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0013497)
